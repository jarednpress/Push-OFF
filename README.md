character design ideas (these are subject to change and we only need 4):

1. eric cartman type fat kid - short arms so cant shove hard but hes heavy with good traction
2. bratty skinny dude with magnifying glass to burn you - sid from toy story kind of - or skateboard kid
3. horse girl - bites people - maybe like girl from nemo
5. wheelchair girl - fast and hits you hard so you're hitstunned but not too much knockback. bad traction
6. kid who is always sick (and maybe bloody nose)
7. nerd kid - this one needs some distinctive traits if it wants to make the cut - ike goob, dexter, or cub scout
8. baby who can hold his own (stewie griffin)
9. held back kid - hes gigantic and slow but powerful but maybe also dumb
10. mamas boy karate kid who is actually a prick - maybe sort of Caillou-like
11. kid who likes bugs way too much - not sure how we make his mechanics do anything special
12. ipad kid, slow zombie but aggressive when you bother him (slow on approach but fast on attack)
