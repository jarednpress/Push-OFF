character design ideas (these are subject to change and we only need 4):

1. eric cartman - short arms so cant shove hard but hes heavy with good traction
2. bratty skinny dude with magnifying glass to burn you - sid from toy story kind of - or skateboard kid
3. horse girl - bites people - maybe like girl from nemo
4. rich kid who is on his phone the whole time but his bodygaurd covers for him when hes near ledge
5. or a little sister whos brother comes to her hair (all she can do is throw paper balls)
6. wheelchair girl - fast and hits you hard so you're hitstunned but not too much knockback. bad traction
7. kid who is always sick (and maybe bloody nose)
8. nerd kid - this one needs some distinctive traits if it wants to make the cut - ike goob, dexter, or cub scout
9. baby who can hold his own (stewie griffin)
10. held back kid - hes gigantic and slow but powerful but maybe also dumb
11. mamas boy karate kid who is actually a prick - maybe sort of Caillou-like
12. kid who likes bugs way too much
13. ipad kid, slow zombie but aggressive when you bother him (slow on approach but fast on attack)
